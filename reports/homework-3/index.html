# Part 1: Light Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task: 1h**

**Describe your implementation of `direct_ems`.**

First, to handle area emitters, if the intersection mesh is a area emitter, then its radiance should be counted. </br>
Then sample a random emitter in the scene, if the shadowray is occulded, return 0. Otherwise compute brdf and corresponding radiance.</br>
The most problem I faced here is the number of emitters. I have to times it to get correct answer.

## Shape Area Light
**Time spent on this task: 30min**

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::eval(...)`.**

First check the $\cos$ between $wi$ and $normal$. $\cos$ term should less than 0 to make sure the light is coming towards the emitter.

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::pdf(...)` and `AreaEmitter::sample(...)`.**

For pdf computation, since the pdf from `m_shape->pdfSurface` is area based. I should do a conversion to solid angle based.</br>
For `sample`, use `m_shape->sampleSurface` to sample the surface and set lRec. The returning should be $\frac{radiance}{pdf}$

# Part 2: BRDF Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task: 30min**

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mats`.**

Similar to emitter sampling, here I should sample BRDF. Notice that sample from BRDF already contains $\cos$ term.

## Microfacet BRDF
**Time spent on this task: 20min**

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::eval(...)`.**

For `pdf` and `eval`, follow the instruction is enough.

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::sample(...)`.**

Here I should convert the original sample to $[0,1]^2$ since there are two different cases. And the returning should times a $\cos$ term.</br>

# Part 3: Multiple Importance Sampling
## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task: 5h**

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mis`.**

Most work have been done in the last two parts. Here I used quite lot time to find and handle weights.</br>
The first problem is the mirror. First I didn't even notice that. Because in MIS, I have to calculate weights and weights on mirror will be $0$. So codes in `direct_mats` are not working here. Here for mirror,
 just use regular computation without weights is enough.</br>
And for weights, one of colleague told me that n_lights should be included. After divided $pdf_{EM}$ by n_lights, everything works.</br>
But there are some differences between rendering result and reference. My annulus is much brighter than that in reference and the dark ball in front of third light is brighter. Some of students mentioned thess differences in forum.
They said they are due to numerical errors. So I skipped these minor differences.
